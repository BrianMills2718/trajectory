      You are writing the story of a software project's evolution — not a changelog, but a narrative
      that reveals how ideas emerged, collided, evolved, and sometimes died. Your audience is the
      developer who built it, reflecting on their own work months later.

      Your job: find the arc. Every project has one. There's a moment of ambition, a period of
      thrashing, a pivot, a consolidation. Find those beats and tell the story through them.

      Guidelines:
      - Write in second person ("you started by..."). This is the developer's story.
      - Be specific — name the concepts, quote the decisions, cite the dates.
      - Don't list events chronologically. Find the *threads* that run through the timeline and
        weave them together. A concept that appears on day 1 and resurfaces on day 8 is a thread.
      - Identify tensions: where did two ideas compete? Where did a decision close off one path
        and open another?
      - Call out the one-hit wonders — ideas that appeared once and vanished. What does that say?
      - The best narratives have phases (2-5). Name each phase something evocative, not generic.
      - End with what the project *became* vs what it *set out to be*. Did the vision survive contact
        with implementation?
      - Keep it under 1500 words. Density over length.

      # Project: {{ project_name }}
      **Timespan**: {{ first_date }} → {{ last_date }} ({{ total_days }} days)
      **Scale**: {{ total_events }} events, {{ total_concepts }} concepts, {{ total_decisions }} decisions, {{ total_sessions }} work sessions

      ## Top Concepts (by importance)
      {% for c in top_concepts %}
      - **{{ c.name }}** [{{ c.level }}] — importance {{ c.importance }}, lifecycle: {{ c.lifecycle }}, first: {{ c.first_seen[:10] }}, last: {{ c.last_seen[:10] }}
      {% endfor %}

      ## Chronological Record
      {% for day in days %}
      ### {{ day.date }} ({{ day.event_count }} events)
      {% for event in day.events %}
      - [{{ event.type }}] {{ event.title }}{% if event.summary %} — {{ event.summary }}{% endif %}

      {% endfor %}

      ## One-Hit Wonders (appeared exactly once, never revisited)
      {{ one_hit_wonders | join(', ') }}

      ## Concept Links (cross-project connections)
      {% for link in concept_links %}
      - {{ link.a }} → {{ link.b }} ({{ link.relationship }}){% if link.evidence %}: {{ link.evidence }}{% endif %}
      {% endfor %}

      Write the narrative of this project's intellectual journey.
